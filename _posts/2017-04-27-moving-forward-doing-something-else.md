Hey there!

My name is **Jergu≈°**. I'm a student doing Computer Science course at **University of Bristol**. I present myself as a **"php developer"** or a **"laravel developer"**. However, in case you want to make fun of me for _loving_ PHP, I can simply be a **"developer"**.

## I want to blog. Why?

**I have recently quit my job.** It no longer was something I'd enjoy. Interesting problems and new challenges turned into old, boring, repetitive tasks of _"moving the button to the right. Just a little bit"_.

**My friends stayed at home.** When I was in high school, I could talk to my friends about dev stuff every day, but after moving to England, we do not communicate as much. Therefore I have **YOU**, my (new) dearest friends. I'll tell you what I learned, how I liked it and why I'll never use it again.

**Someone might find it useful.** I love to share. I love to teach. I love to learn.

## The content

I don't want to make any promises about the content or about the frequency of new posts. I'll write about things that excite me at that moment. However, I'm certain that these topics will eventually appear: laravel, php, git, angular, zsh/bash/cli, refactoring, mac apps...

__Posts are not guaranteed to always make sense.__

Stay tuned.

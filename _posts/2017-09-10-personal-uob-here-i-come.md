**THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL BLOG POST.** Summer is over, I'm heading to a new university and I'm back to blogging! I hope you didn't miss me too much, and if you did, I promise to write more often now, so you should be okay.

### University of Bristol

In a week, I will start a new course at a new university. What an exciting time! I will be joining the Computer Science course at the University of Bristol in, well, Bristol. Last year, I attended the Software Engineering course at the Southampton Solent University. It was not what I expected it to be so I decided to leave. The main reason being that the course was not a particularly good one. It was supposed to teach people how to write an Android app or how to make a PHP website. These are not the skills I'm looking to learn at a university. Thus the change to Computer science.

I'm hoping to explore new, foreign and exciting subjects. I'd love to learn a thing or two about machine learning or visual recognition or artificial intelligence, or something else! Let's just say, I am really excited to join the **UOB**.

That's it. Thank you ðŸŒµ

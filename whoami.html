I am a student doing Computer Science course at the University of Bristol. I have chosen this course mainly because I wanted to explore the theoretical parts of Computer Science as I feel that I have a lot of experience on the practical side of things. I have gained this experience by working with various web development companies and being active in the open source community.

Although I enjoy working on client applications, I find it far more interesting to work on a piece of tooling for developers as it directly affects how I work. I try to optimise my workflow as much as possible and if I manage to create a tool or a component that I think might be used by other developers, I do that! I have built and open-sourced an Oh-My-ZSH plugin with enables autocompletion for `symfony/console` based CLI applications. This plugin can be found on my GitHub account.

Recently, I have helped to co-create "stefanzweifel/laravel-stats" package. It is a "rake stats" inspired tool for Laravel applications. I really enjoyed working on this as the tool enable me, and hundreds of other developers, to get more insight into my applications.

Regarding my experience, I work a lot with web applications written mainly in PHP. As I work as a full-stack developer I regularly use JS frameworks as well. I do not limit myself to a PHP/JS developer and I make use of a lot of other technologies/languages. For the past few weeks I have been working on a macOS app that speeds up opening my projects on GitHub/Gitlab, turns email notifications from these services into native macOS ones and couple other things. This is another example of how much I enjoy automating common tasks. I also have experience with working on a production Ruby on Rails app. Vagrant, Docker, git, linux, bash, REST API, Redis are not foreign to me.
